The business works with all insurance companies but is not in contract with any of them, giving them more pricing flexibility. They only use OEM parts (not used, salvaged or aftermarket) and focus more on increasing revenue per car versus bringing in more cars. They buy significant OEM parts from their leading supplier making them the fifth largest customer in the nation for purchasing those particular parts. Currently they have around $381,700 in FF&E.
50% of business is repeat customers, 20% are from Google reviews, and 30% are referrals. They work on three to five cars per week and have an average order value ranging from $13,000 to $15,000 per claim.
The owners’ roles will need to be replaced as they want to pursue other entrepreneurial ventures and have the flexibility to move out of state.

The company has a cult following, does in-house social media, and has connections to major influencers and celebrities who showcase their products. Clients are 80% B2B (large wholesale stores) and 20% B2C; eCommerce revenue is 100% through the company’s website. The majority of the inventory is held in China by the supplier. Once they need it, it gets shipped directly to the consumer for large accounts (they keep very minimal inventory on hand for smaller orders).
There was a drop in revenue from 2020 to 2021/2022 as they were catering mainly to one big box store, so they were hit hard when the sales dropped off. They had to diversify and use this time to increase their sales with other big customers. They also changed their offerings this time and started developing bags, hats, etc. This was an expensive pivot; they needed time to gain their buyers’ trust, but by 2023, sales were climbing again.
The company has recently achieved several exciting new initiatives, such as launching a collection with major online fashion retailers, introducing a new premium line of handbags, securing subscription box programs, and signing new contracts.
While the business will experience slight increases in COGS due to foreign tariffs, they are well-prepared to handle these fluctuations. Since the tariffs only apply to retail goods (about 20% of their revenue) and not to the 80% wholesale side, they will not be hit as hard as competitors. Additionally, they already have extremely high markups and margins on products so adjusting those a bit to accommodate any increased tariffs will not do much to negatively impact the bottom line.
They have a staff of five, including an operations manager who they are confident will stay with the company post-sale. The majority owner is open to staying with the company in their current marketing and sales role for a few years.
