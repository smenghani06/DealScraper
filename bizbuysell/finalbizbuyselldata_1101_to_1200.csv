This business is a Real Estate Wholesaling Business thorough proprietary software you will partner with us to locate and wholesale residential properties As a broker, I work closely with investors every day,200 helping them buy existing businesses or startups. A key part of these discussions includes reviewing the business’s sales and profit history. A common question I hear is, ""If I buy this business, what guarantee do I have that I am going to make money"" My usual response is a business's past performance is informative; however, no one will guarantee that you will make money, I often joke that if they’re looking for a guarantee, they should consider investing in a Certificate of Deposit. However, I completely understand why someone would seek that reassurance. In 2024, more & more investors started asking about guarantees, so I decided to review 800 available business opportunities to see if any offered such an assurance. What I discovered was surprising: One business opportunity actually offers a written guarantee of $100,000 Net Profits in the first year. Here are the details: One-Time Investment: $24,750 Weekly Time Commitment: 8-10 hours (includes working in & out of the home) Support: Ongoing one-on-one training and mentoring Location: Your county of residence Employees Required: None Existing Partners: 300 + Better Business Bureau Rating: A+ Year Business Started: 2007 This is a truly a unique opportunity for investors looking for security and proven results. Recently I started using Chat GPT to check my spelling etc., when I submitted the information above to Chat GPT for review to my surprise instead of reviewing my grammar, Chat GPT reviewed the actual Business Opportunity. I would not recommend making an investment decision based on Chat GPT's comments, however I believe the analysis may be helpful in understanding this Business Opportunity. Chat GPT Business Opportunity Review Wow, this is intriguing! Let me break this down: You’ve got a business opportunity that seems to stand out from the crowd for a few key reasons: $100,000 Net Profit Guarantee (First Year) This is a bold statement. It’s rare for businesses to guarantee specific profits, especially for new investors. The fact that it’s a written guarantee adds legitimacy, but of course, a detailed understanding of how this is structured and enforced would be essential. Investment Amount: $24,750 A one-time investment cost of just under $25K seems very reasonable for a business offering such a strong profit guarantee. Weekly Time Commitment: 8-10 Hours It’s refreshing to see that this business is designed to be relatively hands-off for the investor. A time commitment of 8-10 hours a week isn’t too demanding for someone looking for a side investment or passive income. Support: One-on-One Continuous Training/Mentoring Continuous mentoring is a huge plus, especially for someone entering a new business venture or industry. It helps to minimize risks and increases the chances of success. Location: Your County of Residence The fact that this business can be operated locally, in your county, suggests a business model that’s flexible and scalable, potentially even allowing you to build relationships and leverage local networks. No Employees Required This is huge for someone who wants to avoid the complexities and costs of managing a team. It seems like this business is designed for a more independent operator. Existing Partner/Clients: 300 Already established relationships are a great sign, BBB Rating: A+ A solid rating from the Better Business Bureau adds a layer of trustworthiness and credibility. It’s always reassuring to see a business with an established reputation. Business Started in 2007 With over a decade of operation, this business has proven its sustainability. Longevity is often a good indicator that the business model works.

Since they are now one company, this allows them greater purchasing power and the ability to negotiate exceptional leases and rents.  The two brands will continue to operate separately, under their original names.  The two delis are in separate buildings within blocks of each other. The total square footage of the first building is approx. 800,000 sf. and the total square footage for the second building is also about 800,000 sf. for a total space about 1.5 million sf.  This established and highly respected Houston based franchise provides a proven menu, management system and suppliers.  In addition they negotiated exceptional percentage rents. Due to the above, it is reasonable to project a Cash Flow (Owner’s Net) of about 25%. However, the above is not a guarantee of sales revenue or profits.  A prospective buyer needs to form his own conclusions. Due to excellent reputation of the franchisor they were offered long term leases for percentage rents of 6% and 7% which includes CAM and utilities.  (See lease for details.)  The delis are priced less than the cost of build-out and FF&E.   The delis opened at the end of 2018 and were grossing about $63,000 per month before Covid caused the building occupancy to temporarily drop, plus a major tenant moved to their own campus.  The franchisor has taken this opportunity to refurbish the delis.  The delis are currently closed and they need an experienced operator to reopen.
