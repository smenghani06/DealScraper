In addition to a variety of traditional chiropractic and massage therapies, they provide technologically-advanced options for treating pain, injuries and disease that include ARP wave therapy (used with professional athletes), cold laser therapy (or LEDs), Naomi digital Xray system, kinesio-taping, nonsurgical spinal decompression, Electro Muscle Stimulation (EMS), Ultrasound pain therapy, and the use of Active Therapeutic Machines (ATM). This comprehensive range of treatments sets them apart from other chiropractic practices and pain management clinics. For common spinal alignment issues, Company relies on the Pro-Adjuster System, now known as Sigma Instruments. This comfortable computerized assessment and adjustment tool replaces the awkward manual evaluation and adjustments – patients simply sit in a massage chair that evaluates the spine and administers appropriate adjustments.

I never allowed a complaint because I project managed every job. Read Google reviews to verify. I've sold commercial and residential and subcontracted the labor to over 10 high quality and insured local 1099 crews. This allows for efficient operations without the need for a large, permanent staff. My subs are certified by Carlisle, Duro-last, GAF, and OC. We are certified by many manufacturer's to pull there NDL warranties also. The business is primed for fast growth with the right investment. Any marketing budget injects a surge of calls. There is repeat business that comes in and referrals especially after a hailstorm. There’s untapped potential in commercial accounts with local owners, something I never pursued despite demand. Oreillys auto is one that continues to call. If a buyer wanted to invest in full time repair crews, the commercial repair business is lucrative. The established website is on Google maps and Google Guaranteed and Yelp. The phone system is easily transferred and CRM with photos and files. Google,BBB, and advertising platforms will allow a name change and brand migration if you wanted to keep the reviews and history. Austin has had hailstorms every year for 6 years, creating a lucrative market. National roofers from the DFW and Colorado are setting up shop here, looking to capitalize on this demand. For a larger company looking to sell 2 to 5 million in roofing projects after just one hailstorm, acquiring this established local business with this reputation would be a perfect entry point. The credibility, installer connections, and 5 star market presence is what the right buyer needs to hit the ground running as opposed to starting from scratch. I have only happy customers because I managed every job which is harder for a large company to do. When looking at the website, one thinks they're dealing with a 10 million dollar contractor because of the professionalism. Whether your an experienced roofing company looking to enter this lucrative market or an entrepreneur ready to grow the business further, this is a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. I’m open to staying on as a consultant or commission-based sales rep during a transition period, ensuring a smooth handoff and offering my expertise to help the new owner hit the ground running. Alternatively, if the buyer is experienced and ready to take full control, I’m happy to step aside and get out of the way. This isn’t a big cash flow business unless deals are being actively sold, but for the right buyer with a growth mindset and resources, it could be a goldmine. I've handled high-profile projects, like the Austin Police roof, Local ER Hospitals, Storage facilities, Carls Juniors, and also many residential projects over the years entirely through subcontracting. I've also left town for a month and sold after hurricanes for other contractors. This is why its never scaled. The office I rent is tiny and the warehouse storage i rent is also small because I try not to store extra materials. But no one goes to your office in this business. All of this can be done from your home virtually or I can help you with many local sales reps and installers if you wanted to expand and grow quickly. If you wanted to keep me on as an equity only owner with a small percentage and only pay me a commission of my sales, all is negotiable. I am open to building this business for you with the right investment. If the right investor wants to inject $750k to $1 million into the business and have a majority of the control. I will do most of the work and grow this business for you quickly in 3 to 5 years. With commercial accounts, doing over 10 million a year is easily realised in this market within 3 years.","{'Location:': 'Austin, TX', 'Inventory:': 'Included in asking price', 'Real Estate:': 'Leased', 'Building SF:': 'N/A', 'Lease Expiration:': 'N/A', 'Employees:': '1099', 'Furniture, Fixtures, & Equipment (FF&E):': 'Included in asking price', 'Facilities:': 'Truck negotiable', 'Competition:': 'Austin is booming!

A family calendar/directory website serving families around Bexar County, TX. This site is a member of the Fun 4 US Kids network. In addition to Fun 4 Alamo Kids, there are 18 franchises in Florida, 1 in St. Louis, Missouri, and 1 in Raleigh, North Carolina. What does a franchisee do? Franchisees earn revenue by selling ads on the website to locally owned businesses wanting to promote their businesses or event to San Antonio families. Most of this work is done via email and social media messaging. Franchisees are also responsible for promoting their sites on social media, email newsletters, working events, and other marketing methods to grow their site traffic. Franchisees are required to have at least one dedicated content manager on their team responsible for curating content and ensuring the directory and calendar are up to date, accurate, and as comprehensive as possible. We currently have 2 content managers and a social media manager who all live in the San Antonio area. What are the benefits of running a Fun 4 US Kids franchise? - Franchisees can work from home (or anywhere with internet), and make their own schedule. All of our current franchisees are moms and dads with school aged children. Franchisees work around their kids schedules. Franchisees can take sick days and vacations whenever it suits their schedule. - Franchisees keep 100% of all the revenue earned from selling ads. PLUS because the site is part of a network, there is an opportunity to participate in group advertising deals from advertisers placing ads on multiple sites in the network. - Franchisees can also negotiate trade deals for advertising - for example, running ads on the site in exchange for tickets to events or programs, camps, or birthday parties for their kids. - Fun 4 US Kids provides full training and ongoing business coaching and support. We have a website with tutorials, templates, best practices and guidelines. We also offer monthly workshops on varying topics. Why is the business for sale? Fun 4 US Kids has been running this business corporately since 2020. In that time, we have grown the business so much that it really needs someone living in the market to run it. In addition, since 2020, the number of franchisees in our network has doubled. We would like to sell the business to a mom or dad living in San Antonio so that we can focus more of our time and resources to supporting our current franchisees and growing our network, and so the Fun 4 Alamo Kids business can have someone focus their full attention to managing it and growing it even more. The asking price is $50,000. The business is turnkey and profitable. The business has been rapidly growing and 2024 sales year to date are up 100% over last year.

The plans are instant download PDFs, so a completely digital product. I have sold thousands and thousands of plans through the website, and their are great customer videos and pictures of builds all over the internet. It has been been making $30-60K net profit over previous years, but has started to drift down, currently making $20K last year.  Last three year average at $24K.  Priced off a bit under 4x multiple on last three years SDE. See the attachment below for 7 years of history. I bought this business in 2010 and have just let it sit with a few minor updates since then. I spend ZERO time on this business per year. Basically a zero percent chargeback rate. I offer no customer support and just give a refund if someone wants it (maybe happens 1 time per year.) If someone loses their plan I just automatically send them a new one, I don't even bother to check if they have purchased.  Really, it is zero workload. If you are at all interested in web businesses and DIY hobbies in the shop, this business is for you.  Building the product requires some welding - it is basically an intro welding project. (Many schools have used my plans for their classes.) But I have never built one myself, and I have never updated the plans even once. The website is simple Wordpress. Just rebuilt it using Gutenberg blocks and it's currently running Woocommerce (was using EDD in the past.) There are 2 SKUs depending on what plan package you want. Selling at 59 and 79 bucks.  I have it on shared hosting, so this literally costs me nothing to run. There are some growth opportunities in selling other plans, parts required for the builds, etc. I have a database of thousands of prior customer emails - never emailed them. Yours for growing if you care at all! For due diligence, I will give you access to the Paypal and Stripe transaction files, and access to the plans, I have google analytics too, but was using an old GA tracker that disappeared - but can give you access to the new UA tracker.

This property occupies a prime position at the northwest corner of US Hwy 69 N and Stewart Street (CR 432), along the west line of US Hwy 69 N at the northern edge of the Lindale city limits. The site benefits from a favorable highway location near new commercial developments. The property encompasses approximately 71.8534 acres, described in 8 adjacent tracts out of the J. H. Sanders Survey, A-1118, Smith County, Texas. The land area is divided into two main portions: the support site, which spans 16.2408 acres (707,449 SF), and the excess land, covering 55.6126 acres (2,422,487 SF), totaling 71.8534 acres (3,129,936 SF). The subject land area includes both areas within and outside the Lindale city limits, providing good visibility and access for the front portion. The property features significant improvements from its time as a wholesale nursery, including a large manufacturing and cold storage distribution warehouse with administrative offices, numerous greenhouses, and open sun fields. The main building, located near the entrance, has a GBA of approximately 69,764 SF, constructed from steel and masonry with brick and metal siding. The condition is average to below average. Other buildings include a 4,048 SF shop/warehouse and a 640 SF masonry block pump house. Additionally, there are about 73 greenhouses totaling 304,492 SF with varying quality, ages, sizes, and irrigation methods. In addition to the greenhouses, there are 63 sun fields (range plots) covering roughly 9.3 acres of land area (405,300 SF). Each sun field has water (both drip and sprinklered) and electricity available, as well as poly ground covering. Other site improvements include approximately 56,352 SF of concrete paving for drives, parking, and access to the warehouse, 555 SF of covered sidewalks at the office entrance, 420 SF of open sidewalks at the office, 39,100 SF of asphalt paving for the office parking area, 50,000 SF of gravel paving serving as drives around the greenhouses, a 1,900 SF partially enclosed shed attached to the shipping dock area, 3,785 LF of chain fencing along road frontage, a good iron entry gate and signage, and a 157-foot-tall cell/radio tower. The property has a major irrigation system based on 4 deep wells (460 feet deep) that pump ground water into a large, lined man-made earthen reservoir equipped with a treatment facility. Underground PVC piping serves each greenhouse and sun field, providing sufficient water pressure to irrigate the entire nursery operation. The property improvements were built between the 1970s and the 1990s, with renovations and updates over the years. The support site is a corner plot slightly above street grade, located at the NWC of US Hwy 69 and CR 432. It wraps around two single-family properties that front along US Hwy 69 and includes a detention reservoir and pump house in the southwest portion. The site has an irregular configuration with frontage along US Hwy 69 N and Stewart Street, providing above-average visibility due to its gently sloping upward terrain. The topography is mostly open and developed, with no portion of the support site in the 100-year floodplain. Zoned as MU-1 (Light Industrial), the support site has all utilities present, including electric, city water, sewer, natural gas, hi-speed internet, and cable service. The excess land site, which wraps around the support site, has an irregular configuration and sufficient access from US Hwy 69 N and Stewart Street. The terrain is mostly open, with some wooded areas along steeper slopes. The topography includes level bottomland and steeply sloping sections, with a small creek and pond on the north portion.
