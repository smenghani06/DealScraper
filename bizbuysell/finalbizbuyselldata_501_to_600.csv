Why are pool routes better than buying a traditional business? If you compare incomes vs asking prices it’s very clear. A route generating $50,000 per year will sell for roughly $50,000. A traditional business making the same income would cost $100,000 or more to purchase. There are other great benefits as well. Give us a call to learn more.

This well-established, and successful, 9-year-old family owned and operated company was incorporated in 2015, by its owner and founder. The seller wanted more than just a place for beauty treatments; she envisioned a sanctuary where clients could escape the stresses of daily life and experience true renewal. They carry a luxury product line, which features the pure flower and plant essences. With over 20 years of experience, she spent years owning and managing one of the Classic Cuts family hair salons before following her true passion—creating a unique spa experience. This vision led her to establish this salon, a sanctuary for relaxation and renewal. They use natural products and the seller has a very strong relationship with the products distributor. She will be able to transfer her many-year relationship to the new owner if they want to continue offering the same luxury products. The salon’s revenue mix is approximately 99% from hair styling and only about 1% waxing services. The seller has a training manual for their software program, and they also benefit from grandfathered pricing for their software package at only $107 per month, which manages booking appointments, inventory, reporting, service providers set up, etc. From the moment their clients step inside, the goal is simple: to help them feel refreshed, rejuvenated, and restored.

The salon has two staff, consisting of the owner and another stylist. The seller works in the salon approximately 33 hours per week The other stylist is paid hourly wages plus tips, and the seller is paid hourly wages and is a W-2 employee of the company. The salon’s maximum staffing capacity are nine stylists, 1 spa tech, and it can it can accommodate more stylists and spa techs if they are placed on a rotation schedule. Adding a rotation schedule will generate more income as the stations are not just sitting empty as they would always have clients in the chair which would maximize revenue.
