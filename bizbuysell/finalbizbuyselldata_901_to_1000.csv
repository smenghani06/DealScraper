Having established brand name recognition and a strong reputation in the industry, the owner is ready to move forward toward retirement. However, he is willing to transition for up to two years or consult for the right buyer. The ideal buyer has a passion for dogs, dog training, an interest in training and working with law enforcement, and has the capital and energy to grow the service delivery capabilities to meet demand. While the owner has vast knowledge in this field, he is confident he can train the right person to take over.  The owner has extensive experience as an industry trainer who has trained people and dogs, including other trainers. The buyer needs to have strong ethics and common sense in order to learn, implement, and dominate competitors who treat their businesses with less discipline. High standards are required to provide the service in the way it needs to be delivered to protect clients, and in many cases, school children. The climate for increased security in schools and critical facilities is intensifying. Opportunities exist for this business to scale and partner with large multi-national security firms that do not do detection.  There is no marketing at all. This company has trained staff and trained canines that provide education and detection of contraband in schools and corporations, including  training law enforcement agencies and their canines throughout the US.  The business operates with staff in CA and TX who are deployed nationwide. A new owner can assume the CA location via a lease, or purchase the real estate, or relocate the business to anywhere that suits them. The CA location was based on an early philosophy to demonstrate that if this business could succeed in CA schools, it could succeed in schools in other states. Other customers include large corporations who will pay the travel costs for dog handlers and dogs. This is a niche business with low attention and awareness and vulnerable competitors, which makes it ripe for a seasoned businessperson to take it to the next level.  But again, the business savvy and resources must be equaled by discipline and ethics.","{'Inventory:': 'Included in asking price', 'Employees:': '10', 'Furniture, Fixtures, & Equipment (FF&E):': 'Included in asking price', 'Facilities:': 'The business currently occupies 2,000 sf.
