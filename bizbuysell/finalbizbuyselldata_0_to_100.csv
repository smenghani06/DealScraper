The company has developed an innovative method of overhauling the entire function of a medical practice, that increases medical practice revenue by as much as 50% without ever increasing the number of patients the physicians see. The company offers a comprehensive approach in transforming practice management, billing, and electronic medical record keeping. Many practices and providers commonly lack understanding when it comes to coding and billing, so this company's goal is to fill those gaps with thorough training. 1) 	Strategic Partnerships. Strong relationship with accountable care organizations (ACOs) in the industry. These organizations are tasked with managing the quality at primary care offices. Billing companies that partner with ACOs ore more likely to maintain a competitive edge and keep market share. This business holds strategic partnerships with local ACOs b ensure that business remains strong. 2) 	Client Retention. Most billing contracts last about 3-5 years and most physicians will switch billing after their contract expires. In-house billing companies aren't able to keep up with industry changes and its increasing complexity. This business is able to retain more clients by keeping pace with industry trends and changes with a tiered information distribution system that starts with top management and flows down to middle management and the practices themselves. 3)          Automation and Efficiency. Typical billers con only handle 2-3 pract automation and technology, T,ey are able to handle more work with less staff. Their automated services provide more value to clients and as a result, allow them to hold more pricing power in the market. 4) Days in Accounts Receivable.
