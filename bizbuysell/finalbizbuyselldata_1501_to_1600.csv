The owner, who bought out their spouse's share in 2013, has since consolidated operations to this main office. This strategic consolidation, driven by the owner's retirement plans, reflects a desire to scale back rather than any financial difficulties.

It offers a wide range of products, including single, bifocal, and progressive vision lenses, titanium frames, transition lenses, designer eyewear, and Rec Specs for various sports and activities.

In 2023, it generated $576,766 in revenue with a seller's discretionary earnings (SDE) of $154,846 and holds over $380,000 in inventory. Its competitive edge lies in its quick turnaround time for lenses and strong relationships with local optometrists who drive referrals.

The company is currently completing a $1.6M athletic field in Rowlett, along with two new youth football and soccer fields in various North Texas communities. which they expect to complete in the coming months. Over the past four years, this company has generated solid and quickly growing revenues of $2.1M in 2020 and up to $2.8M, in 2023, and it has generated cash flows of between of $267K to $1M, respectively. According to a recently updated P&L for Year 2024, the company had revenues of only $2,074M, which was one of its weakest years from a revenue standpoint in several years due a couple of large projects, in excess of $1M, which slipped from Year 2024 into Year 2025, when the company expects to have one of its largest revenue years in the past five years, which could top $8M. By burning off inventory in 2024, the company was still able to turn in strong profits, of $706K in SDE, in spite of  of that reduced revenue level. The company could double in revenues in Year 2025 based on known backlog of projects that are forecasted. Its current backlog includes a committed large Louisiana project which includes five fields which are valued at $6.5M, which has been delayed due to a hurricane several weeks ago. Both  the LA fields, valued at $6.5M and the Farm League project, valued at $2M, are expected to be completed in Year 2025. Given that the company has been earning SDE in the 30%-35% of revenue range, recently, the seller would consider a fair earn out split on those jobs to be in the 15%-17.5% range of revenues for these projects.  Any new jobs secured prior to closing would be negotiated on a case by case basis in a manner which is fair to both parties. They typically collect deposits for new jobs valued at 50% of the project cost, upon project award and the remaining 50% upon project completion.  Unearned deposits accrued at closing will transfer to the buyer for use as working capital to complete the work in progress. Also included in the sales price are Accounts Receivables which are valued at $1,349,018. The sales price will be adjusted accordingly, dollar for dollar, depending on the actual value of the company's accounts receivables, on hand, at closing.
