Opened in 2019, the business specializes in Philly cheesesteaks, chicken sandwiches, fries, and chicken wings, and has built a loyal customer base over the years. The restaurant is situated in a high-traffic retail strip mall in east Dallas, benefiting from strong visibility by one of the busiest streets in the area and proximity to major national retailers, attracting significant foot traffic, primarily from local families and individuals in surrounding residential neighborhoods. While there is some competition in the area from other fast food chains and independent restaurants, none of them specialize in Philly cheesesteaks, giving this location a distinct advantage. The business also stands out due to its use of higher-quality ingredients and the strength of the franchise's brand, offering further differentiation from other food options in the market. The business¡¯s marketing is managed by the corporate office and includes direct mailers, loyalty programs, a website, and social media presence. While effective, there is room for improvement, particularly in promoting catering services. The business also has growth potential through better use of its point-of-sale (POS) system for inventory and customer management, as well as opportunities for a new owner to increase profits through more hands-on involvement in day-to-day operations. Currently, the owner works less than 10 hours per week, operating the business on a semi-absentee basis.
