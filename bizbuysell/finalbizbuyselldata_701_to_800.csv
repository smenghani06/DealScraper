She initially worked out of her house, then spread to several sheds in her backyard, eventually growing into a small facility to store and stage her work. At that time, she worked with a handful of designers in their clients’ homes. As time went on, our seller built a reputation for Christmas décor installation. She had contracts with Southwestern Bell, Harvey Hotels, Gleneagles Country Club and Park Place Lexus. In 2015, the owner then began focusing on commercial wholesale growth instead of home decorating services. Today, the Company provides beautiful manufactured floral arrangements on a wholesale basis to retailers including marque stores such as HOME GOODS, WAYFAIR, NEIMAN MARCUS and others.... It also sells products on its website, and customers can also visit the warehouse to purchase individual, retail arrangements. The manufacturing process is very defined and requires hands-on processes by owner and her Reproduction Designers. The process consists of the following steps: • Set up of production line. The floral arrangements in a customer order are assembled in stages. Instead of building one complete arrangement at a time, each step is completed for all items in the order before moving on to the next step. • Dye all raw materials. • Build each styrofoam and moss base. • Assemble the main components of each product. • Add filler and finalize each arrangement. • Box for shipping. The Company employs five full-time employees. The staff works 8am to 4pm Monday through Thursday and 8am to 3pm on Friday. The current owner works approximately 30 hours per week in the business. She is involved in all aspects. A new owner will need to have a background in creative design and be able to develop new products. He or she will also need to develop and maintain relationships with the Company’s key customers, be able to multi-task and be involved in all aspects of the business. Supporting the owner are five key employees: • Office Administrator – Handles all financial transactions. • Shipping – One employee manages the logistics and shipping process. • Manufacturing – Three employees are involved in the manufacturing of the floral arrangements.","{'Location:': 'Dallas, TX', 'Inventory:': 'Not included in asking price', 'Real Estate:': 'Leased', 'Building SF:': '4,300', 'Lease Expiration:': '5/25/2025', 'Employees:': '5', 'Furniture, Fixtures, & Equipment (FF&E):': 'Included in asking price', 'Facilities:': 'The Company operates out of a leased 4,762-square-foot facility.

LISTING REF # 76931-409496 In business for over a decade InfinteVR, a virtual reality licensor, generates profit margins just under 50% with its nearly fully absentee model. The VR units that are currently placed in malls (8 total) are run by local licensees of the brand, with two Corporate locations. The seller is offering the opportunity to be the licensor of InfiniteVR. A buyer could simply maintain the current structure and enjoy the healthy, mostly absentee SDE that was over $81,000 in 2024 and was just under $60,000 in 2023 with revenues of $170,110 and $140,187 respectively. The seller will work with the buyer to make introductions and foster relationships with his vendors, his repair and maintenance team and the licensees. He will also be available longer term as a consultant. There are many options for a new owner: 1. Continue to maintain and support the current licensees. The seller implemented an extended warranty service piece to the business model, and this recurring revenue quickly generated over 50% of the revenue that’s being brought in by licensing fees. 2. Sell the concept and units to new licensees. Included in the sale are 8 preowned units and 1 new unit to give the buyer a head start on signing up new licensees.

While there is still a strong market for this model in high-end malls, there are ample other opportunities to expand. 4. The buyer could open “corporate owned” locations.
