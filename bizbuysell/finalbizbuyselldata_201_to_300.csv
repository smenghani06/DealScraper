Get NAID AAA certified to enhance your status and visibility. The industry association is helpful and respected: https://isigmaonline.org/ Our former business website is also available: www.trexshred.com and you can see a photo of the mobile shred truck and box truck. The business model: Business are keenly aware of the importance of securely destroying paper that is created in their offices. Your uniformed personnel arrive on regularly scheduled times to service the bins and consoles within the office. Bins are ""swapped"" out, and consoles are unlocked, replacing the inner collection bag with an empty. Your most profitable model is to service your customers with the box truck and return to your facility to shred and bale the paper (called plant-based, or offsite shredding). Most customers will use this method. Some will require onsite shredding (typically banks and financial institutions) where you will use your mobile shred truck. In this case, you will arrive with an extra bin which is used to dump the console shred bags into, then this bin and any other bins are rolled to the mobile shred truck where the hydraulic lift dumps the bin into the truck for shredding. The reason offsite shredding is most profitable is the lower cost of using the box truck, the fast throughput of the Amerishred shredder, and the higher resale value of baled, shredded paper from the paper mills. Either way, your customer gets a Certificate of Destruction along with their monthly invoice. This B2B business has virtually no bad debts, and regularly-scheduled service means consistent invoicing, consistent cash flow, and consistent A/R collections. Growing revenues comes from word-of-mouth, website SEO, and simply knocking on doors for other businesses in the same office building where you already have a customer. The greater density you can get on a route, the more profitable a route becomes. Don't forget about the residential one-off customer: walk-in business for a few boxes is $50, or $65 if they want to watch the documents being shredded, cash or credit card. This business is ready-to-go. Our consulting service comes with the equipment for free. Start with yourself, then grow and add staff as needed.

Strong Real Estate Market: The Dallas/Fort Worth area is predicted to be one of the hottest real estate markets in the nation in 2025. Continued demographic growth and economic development drive demand for housing, boosting the need for home staging services. Increased Home Sales: Home sales in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area have been on the rise, with a 15.21% year-over-year increase in December 2024. This trend is expected to continue, creating more opportunities for staging businesses as sellers look to make their properties more appealing to buyers. Affordability and Accessibility: Predicted lower mortgage rates and reduced borrowing costs will make home purchasing more accessible. This increased affordability is likely to drive higher transaction volumes, further supporting the demand for staging services. Evolving Staging Trends: New staging trends, such as using bold, expressive color schemes and creative light fixtures, are gaining popularity. Staging businesses that stay updated with these trends can attract more clients looking to make their homes stand out in a competitive market. The business offers full and partial home staging services, consulting & decluttering services, and furniture packages for rental properties.
