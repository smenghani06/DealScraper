LISTING REF # 76931-668591 This first and only USDA-certified organic juice and food cafe boasts high sales volume and presents an excellent opportunity for health enthusiasts seeking an established, operational franchise that is easy to manage on an absentee-owner basis. Beautifully designed and strategically located in a high-traffic strip center in The Woodlands, this establishment has all the essentials to ensure a new owner's success! The rapidly growing franchise has thrived by providing clean, high-quality, organic food for busy, on-the-go lifestyles. For instance, they offer a non-GMO, organic cold-pressed juice produced at the optimal time on the farm where the fruits and vegetables are grown and harvested, and then preserved using state-of-the-art high-pressure, no-heat processing (HPP) technology. In addition to their cold-pressed juices, they offer the same high-quality standard: sandwiches, wraps, acai bowls, salads, smoothies, snacks, toasts, and other healthy and delicious options. This business has demonstrated impressive sales growth over the years but requires some expertise to reach a higher level of profitability, making this an asset sale. The seller has invested approximately $490,000 in leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and has dedicated considerable time to obtaining permits, and licenses, hiring, training employees, and creating a turnkey establishment ready for immediate takeover with minimal effort required for new ownership.

This dry cleaner offers typical dry cleaning services, including laundry and alterations. The current owner acquired the business in 2018, and although they decided to relocate it a year ago, this move had no impact on sales. The only setback experienced by this business was during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there was a temporary slowdown in operations. However, the business has since recovered and has had consistent sales since 2021. The business currently enjoys a prime location in a prosperous neighborhood in northwest Dallas. Situated at the end cap of a retail strip center, the business occupies a 1,800 sq. ft. facility, complete with the added convenience of a drive-thru. The customer base primarily consists of individuals and families with mid to upper incomes residing nearby. The business also maintains a single wholesale account. The immediate area boasts minimal competition, as many competitors were forced to shut down their operations due to the impact of COVID-19. Furthermore, this business maintains a dedicated and loyal customer base who frequent this well-established establishment. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, this business has demonstrated remarkable resilience with consistent sales. Moreover, there is untapped potential for further growth. Acquiring more wholesale accounts and providing pickup and delivery services could serve as additional revenue streams. The business can also propel its sales to the next level by implementing a proactive marketing strategy. Currently, relying solely on word-of-mouth advertising limits its potential, but this dry cleaner can boost its revenue with minor marketing efforts.
