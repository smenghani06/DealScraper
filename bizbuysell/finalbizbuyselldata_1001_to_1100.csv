Services include removals/transport, embalming, refrigeration and cremation. No services are provided to the general public. In 2023, the business performed ~1680 cremations and is on track for ~2,000 this year. The business averages 100-120 calls per month on the mortuary side and also contracts with a couple of national shipping companies. In 2023, the business had ~316 Embalming and ~189 Cremation customers with the top 10 customers accounting for approximately ~65% of sales. Top 10 embalming clients account for ~86% of sales and top 10 cremation clients account for ~81% of sales. A major customer has been suspended, due to non-payment of invoices. However, the business recently added a new national account that is expected to drive 20% of 2024 sales. There is a lot of room for growth with proper advertising, networking and adding another vehicle to take on larger volumes. The crematorium has space to add a 3rd retort in current building plus the plumbing is roughed-in for a 4th embalming station. Additionally, there is space on the real estate property to add an accessory building. DEMAND IS INCREASING: There is a steady increase in the trend of individuals choosing cremation (reference National Funeral Directors Association Cremation and Burial Report 2023). The cremation rate was 60.5% in 2023 and is forecast to reach 80% or higher by 2035. The Company's well-trained and long-tenure General Manager holds all necessary licenses and runs all day-to-day operations. The owner primarily handles the financial aspect of the business such as payroll, invoicing, processing payments. Many of these tasks could be replaced with a bookkeeper or clerical staff. (Current owner has chosen to do these tasks.) While the owner has excellent industry knowledge, they readily admit that they lack business and finance training, or the marketing prowess to profitably grow the business. The owner represents that the business has excellent books & records and can prove all sales & expenses. The owner also conducts interviews, fills in when-where needed with embalming-cremation-training of provisional embalmers (infrequent), and assists in teaching apprentice embalmers (infrequent). Owner shares many tasks with GM. The owner takes regular vacations and the GM covers needs while the owner is away. Owner feels that there are many growth opportunities for an aggressive new owner. The business has a strong, central Dallas-Fort Worth location, skilled staff, good reputation and state of the art facility. The business operates primarily as a word of mouth business. Owner estimates that the business is only running at ~30% capacity. Capacity can be significantly increased by adding retorts, improving cremation schedule efficiency and hiring staff for additional shifts. The seller feels that a new, savvy owner needs to reassess pricing and market the business’ services. PURCHASE PRICE: The asking price for the assets of the business is $600,000 with $200,000 CASH down payment and balance financed as a commercial or SBA7(a) loan. If required by a commercial lender, the seller will consider financing up to 10% of the price to a purchaser qualified/approved by the Seller. THE SELLER PREFERS TO SELL FOR ALL CASH.

LISTING REF # 76931-621482 The business offers body contouring treatments that deliver immediate fat loss results, guaranteeing a 2-inch reduction—something no other method provides. Unlike competitors, most body contouring treatments do not offer such guarantees or deliver results as quickly. The business provides highly effective products for fat loss, cellulite reduction, and facials, all with no negative side effects. The fat loss process mimics the body’s natural starvation response, where fat cell contents are drained and used for energy. For facials, the treatments stimulate the body to send a surge of oxygen to the skin’s surface, promoting natural healing and rejuvenation. The business’s treatments provide more dramatic body contouring results compared to competing devices. While many alternatives require up to 3 months to show visible results, their method delivers noticeable changes right away, ensuring faster outcomes. The business utilizes a cutting-edge 3D imaging system to accurately track progress. This system consistently provides before-and-after images, with overlay features and digital measurements for precise tracking of results. Unlike methods that rely on killing fat cells, their approach works by shrinking the fat cells. This eliminates the risk of dysmorphic fat accumulation and avoids the 1 to 3-month wait for fat cells to die. The results are immediate and long-lasting.","{'Location:': 'Lubbock County, TX', 'Inventory:': 'Included in asking price', 'Real Estate:': 'Leased', 'Building SF:': '858', 'Lease Expiration:': '7/31/2025', 'Employees:': '2', 'Furniture, Fixtures, & Equipment (FF&E):': 'Included in asking price', 'Facilities:': 'Lease Terms Options: MTM, or 2 year extension\n\nFacilities: This business is located in a Modern Garden Office in South Lubbock.

Browse the many gift shop items for sale while you relax and chat. Key points and benefits: Steady Sales Growth: Since opening in June 2022, sales have consistently increased, showing strong momentum. January 2025 marked a significant milestone, with sales doubling compared to January two years prior. This sustained growth demonstrates the business’s solid foundation and potential for continued expansion. Corporate Catering Success: A major corporate catering company contract, secured after a year of negotiations in March 2024, is yielding significant returns. Early efforts focused on smaller catering events to build a reputation for reliability and quality. Now, with eight large-scale events lined up for February 2025, catering for 200+ employees per event, projected revenue from these events is estimated at $20,000+. This marks the most successful month with this corporate partner to date. New High-Profile Catering Opportunity: In January 2025, the business secured a once-a-month catering contract with a globally recognized luxury brand. The first event grossed over $1,500, with consistent monthly opportunities moving forward. This reflects the business’s ability to secure prestigious clients and deliver results. Expanded Product Line Driving Community Sales: The introduction of a catering menu into the bakery, featuring popular Croissant Sandwiches and Savory Hand-Pies, has garnered significant community interest. The business is the only one in town offering Pasties, creating a unique market advantage. These additions are expected to drive substantial sales growth over the coming months. Participation in High-Traffic Community Events: The business has been accepted to participate in Carrollton’s Tex Fest in March 2025, an event expected to draw 6,000–10,000 attendees. This provides an excellent opportunity to showcase offerings to a larger audience and generate significant one-day revenue. Increased Foot Traffic from Neighboring Businesses: With two new restaurants opening in the same shopping center—one vibrant Mexican restaurant with live music and a chicken-focused restaurant—the surrounding area is poised for increased foot traffic. This presents new opportunities for cross-promotion and sales growth. Extended Hours to Capture Evening Sales: The business has extended its operating hours to attract customers after dinner, catering to a wider range of dining and snacking needs. Commitment to Community Engagement: Ongoing participation in community events like Tex Fest and other local opportunities continues to expand the customer base and solidify the business as a key player in the area. These combined efforts underscore the business’s strong growth trajectory, its ability to secure high-value partnerships, and its commitment to innovation and community engagement.

Antelope Valley is comprised of three different projects with the current status of the eight wells as follows: 1) six wells permitted, with initial holes drilled in early August 2024, and 2) two wells permitted, to drill in 2024. Eagle Natural Resources considers these projects to be more of a ""mining process"" than an exploration or ""wildcatting"" play since the oil is in place and horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing can be used to extract the oil economically. - We look forward to sharing the merits of adding the Antelope Valley JV to your Oil and Gas Portfolio.
