USA Trucking Consultants has thousands of direct relationships with shipper, brokers, vendors, drivers etc. which we have created over the years, and we do not have a shortage of loads to run, in matter of fact we have so many loads to choose from that we pick and choose the most profitable freight and lanes to run, Finding the freight is one of the easiest parts of this business as the demand for freight that has to be moved on a daily basis There is so much freight to be moved that is outweighs the supply of trucks that are moving the freight on a daily basis. You can start earning money from the first day you open and that means you start making a profit the first week your company starts hauling loads which is unheard of when opening a new business, most people do not pull out a profit when opening a new business for many months or years. As you can see this really is the best business out there because of there being so much freight to haul that you do not have to worry about getting customers, the customers are waiting for you.

They sell all the major categories of: ? liquor including vodka, whisky, bourbon, gin, tequila, rum, scotch, and brandy; ? liqueurs; ? beers including lagers, stout beers, light, and full bodied; ? wines including Cabernet, Merlot, Chardonnay, Sauvignon, Chablis, Chenin Blanc, Zinfandel, Riesling, Champagne, and Prosecco; ? mixers, soft drinks, and snacks. They have a large footprint for shelving and displays to promote their inventory. This includes plenty of cooler space to keep their best-selling beverages of all types cold for customers on the go.

These sites include two express and one flex-serve location, all providing ancillary quick lube services. This acquisition focuses solely on the business assets under long-term NNN leases with Cadet 23 (EPRXT) as the landlord. The three sites generate a proven and established revenue stream through car wash and quick lube services, supported by a large and loyal customer base. Featuring modern facilities equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, efficient POS systems, and strategic layouts, these turnkey operations maximize throughput and profitability. The sites are strategically positioned in high-traffic corridors of Port Arthur, Groves, and Beaumont, TX, capturing significant daily vehicle counts.
