A local favorite breakfast and lunch cafe in an affluent northeast Dallas suburb is now available for acquisition. Originally founded in 2015, the cafe came under new ownership in 2018, leading to nearly doubled sales and consistent growth year after year. The cafe offers a full-service dining experience, serving a range of classic breakfast and lunch menu options that include omelets, crepes, Belgian waffles, French toast, breakfast skillets, sandwiches, wraps, and paninis, accompanied by a variety of sides and beverages. The cafe occupies a 2,800-square-foot space at the end cap of a retail strip facing a major highway. The facility is highly visible and easily accessible, with ample parking. The surrounding area is predominantly residential, with single-family homes and various businesses contributing to steady foot traffic. The location is ideally suited for the business, attracting a diverse customer base that includes older patrons and churchgoers, especially on weekends. The cafe has experienced steady growth with minimal marketing efforts, primarily relying on a modest Facebook presence and hundreds of positive reviews across platforms like Google, Yelp, and third-party delivery apps such as Grubhub, DoorDash, and UberEATS. The business enjoys strong word-of-mouth promotion and a loyal customer base, with many regular patrons. Significant potential exists for further growth by enhancing marketing strategies, such as establishing an official website and expanding social media outreach to reach a broader audience. Competition in the immediate area is minimal, consisting mainly of coffee shops and fast-food establishments, with only one other breakfast and lunch diner nearby. This cafe competes effectively through competitive pricing, friendly service, and quality food made with fresh ingredients. The ample seating space, with the ability to accommodate large groups of 10-16 customers, also gives this cafe a competitive edge.

LISTING REF # 76931-756642 This Graze Craze operates as a storefront charcuterie board business, standing out as one of only three similar service providers in South Texas. Strategically located in a high-income area, it caters to affluent customers while also serving the broader South Texas region. The store occupies a unique niche, offering both catering and to-go services, specializing in snacks and finger foods for small to medium-sized events. Since transitioning to new ownership in May 2023, the business has seen remarkable growth, shifting its focus from primarily household customers to serving corporate and event clientele. This strategic pivot has resulted in an eight-fold revenue increase compared to the previous ownership. Initially intended to operate as an absentee business, the new owners quickly realized the value of hands-on management, despite balancing full-time employment commitments. The Graze Craze business model, focused on charcuterie as a catering alternative and party platter replacement, has gained nationwide momentum. By ordering from this franchise, companies can maintain high-profit margins while keeping costs low. This approach has positioned the South Texas location as one of the top five revenue producers in the entire franchise network. Although still early in its new ownership, the business continues to grow. Occasionally, orders have had to be scaled back due to scheduling conflicts with the owners’ full-time jobs. The business is on pace to do $249k in total revenue with a Seller’s Discretionary Earnings of $71,500, making it an attractive opportunity for prospective buyers. Ideal buyers are individuals who have a passion for crafting charcuterie boards that meet customer needs, with a focus on quality ingredients and superior customer service. Graze Craze competes with catering and party platter services from larger grocery delis, filling a niche that is often overlooked by these larger competitors. With limited competition from other charcuterie providers, there is significant potential for growth, including the opportunity to expand to multiple locations across South Texas.","{'Location:': 'Bexar County, TX', 'Real Estate:': 'Leased', 'Building SF:': 'N/A', 'Lease Expiration:': 'N/A', 'Employees:': '4', 'Furniture, Fixtures, & Equipment (FF&E):': 'Included in asking price', 'Support & Training:': '3 weeks', 'Reason for Selling:': 'conflicting business', 'Franchise:': 'This business is currently an established franchise'}",Business Opportunity,"The Graze Craze franchise stands in a unique industry with little competition, strategically located in a high-income area and boasts eight-fold revenue growth.
